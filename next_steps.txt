# Next Steps & Instructions

Congratulations on verifying the hackathon challenges! Here is what you need to do next to fully enable the features we implemented.

## 1. Environment Configuration (.env)
We have created a `.env` file for you based on `.env.example`.
- **Sentry**: To test Sentry integration, sign up at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), create a project, and add your `SENTRY_DSN` to the `.env` file.
- **MinIO**: The buckets are automatically created by `scripts/setup-s3.ts` in CI or via the `createbuckets` service in Docker.

## 2. GitHub Actions Secrets
The CI/CD pipeline is ready. To enable Docker Hub pushing (optional) or other integrations, go to your GitHub Repo -> Settings -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub Access Token.

(Note: The current `ci.yml` has `push: false` for the build step. Change it to `true` if you want to push images.)

## 3. Running the System
We added a new comprehensive Docker environment including the Frontend Dashboard.

To start everything (Backend, MinIO, Jaeger, Frontend):
```bash
npm run docker:dev
```

- **Frontend Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
- **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001 (User/Pass: minioadmin)

## 4. Architecture Design
Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the proposed solution to the long-running download problem.

## 5. Testing
You can run the full E2E test suite locally:
```bash
# Make sure Docker is running via npm run docker:dev
node --experimental-transform-types scripts/setup-s3.ts
npm run test:e2e
```
